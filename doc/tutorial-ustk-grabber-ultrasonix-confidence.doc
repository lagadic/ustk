\tableofcontents


\section intro_ustk_grabber_confidence Introduction

This tutorial expains how to apply a confidence map algorithm in real-time on frames grabbed from ultrasonix station.

Note that the source code used in this tutorial can be downloaded using the following command :

\code
$ svn export https://github.com/lagadic/ustk.git/trunk/tutorial/ustk/ultrasonix
\endcode

\section ustk_grabber_confidence_example Apply the confidence map on pre-scan images

The following code shows how to apply a confidence map algorithm on a pre-scan image grabbed in real-time, and display the result.

The confidence map is produced using \ref usScanlineConfidence2D class.
 
Note that the code runs in 2 separate threads :
  - The grabbing thread wich reads frames arriving on the network
  - The main thread wich computes the confidence map algorithm on each new frame, and displays the result.

You will need Qt and X11 to run the following code.

\include tutorial-ultrasonix-qt-grabbing-pre-scan-confidence.cpp
